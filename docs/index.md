# ACCESS Toolkit Documentation

Welcome to the main documentation site for the ACCESS Toolkits. Here, you'll find descriptions and documentation for the various toolkits we provide to computational resource providers and users.

## Mirgation Notice

This documentation was migrated and re-branded to ACCESS from the [XSEDE project](https://www.xsede.org/). It was originally developed by the XSEDE [Cyberinfrastructure Resource Integration (CRI)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220819194201/https://www.xsede.org/ecosystem/xcri-mission) team.

## Toolkits
 * The Basic Cluster (BC) software toolkit 
enables campus CI resource administrators to build a local 
cluster from scratch, which is then easily interoperable with 
ACCESS-supported CI resources. BC is very simple in concept: 
pull the lever, have a cluster built for you complete with an 
open source resource manager / scheduler and all of the essential 
tools needed to run a cluster, and have those tools set in place 
in ways that mimic the basic setup on an ACCESS-supported cluster
. The BC is based on the OpenHPC project, and consists of ACCESS
-developed Ansible playbooks and templates designed to ease the 
work required to build a cluster. Consult the ACCESS Knowledge Base 
for complete information about how to use BC to set up a cluster.

 * ACCESS offers a Cluster Monitoring toolkit - compatible with the 
BC or any OpenHPC cluster running Warewulf, that allows sites to 
install tools that monitor both cluster health and job statistics. 
The toolkit allows administrators to generate fine-grained reports 
of usage based on users, projects, and job types, which can be a great 
aid in keeping track of ROI or justifying future funding.
